    "# Reproducible Fraud Detection with LakeFS\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** This project demonstrates a Data-Centric MLOps pipeline for detecting credit card fraud. Unlike traditional scripts, we use **LakeFS** to provide Git-like version control for our data and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset (anonymized real-world transactions).\n",
    "* **Challenge:** The dataset is highly imbalanced (**0.17% fraud** vs. 99.83% legitimate).\n",
    "* **Implication:** Standard accuracy metrics are misleading (a dummy model predicting \"legit\" every time gets 99.8% accuracy). We must prioritize **F1-Score** and **Recall**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Tool: LakeFS\n",
    "\n",
    "**LakeFS** creates a versioning layer over our object storage. It allows us to:\n",
    "* **Commit** data snapshots (just like Git commits code).\n",
    "* **Branch** data for isolated experiments.\n",
    "* **Revert** changes if data becomes corrupted."

    "To establish a \"Golden Record\" of our training data. We will load the raw CSV, generate new predictive features, apply critical preprocessing, and **commit** the result to the `main` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "1.  **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "    * **Time $\\rightarrow$ Hour of Day:** We convert the raw timestamp (seconds) into an `Hour` feature (0-23) to capture circadian patterns in fraud.\n",
    "    * **Amount $\\rightarrow$ LogAmount:** Transaction amounts are highly skewed. We apply a Log transformation (`log1p`) to normalize the distribution for linear models.\n",
    "2.  **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Since fraud cases are rare (0.17%), we synthesize new fraud examples to balance the training set.\n",
    "3.  **Standard Scaling:** We normalize the features (V1-V28, Hour, LogAmount) so algorithms like Neural Networks converge faster.\n",
    "4.  **LakeFS Commit:** We upload the processed `train.csv` and `test.csv` to LakeFS and commit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "By committing these files to `main`, we ensure that every subsequent experiment starts from the **exact same data snapshot** (including our engineered features), guaranteeing reproducibility."

    "* **Winning Model:** The **Random Forest** model (~0.85 F1) emerged as the top performer. Its ability to handle non-linear decision boundaries allows it to effectively leverage categorical-like features such as the engineered `Hour`.\n",
    "* **Ensemble Strategy:** The **Power Ensemble** (Tree-based only) significantly outperformed the **Basic Ensemble**, confirming that including weaker linear models (like Logistic Regression) dilutes overall performance.\n",
    "* **Model Constraints:** The **Logistic Regression** baseline struggled significantly (F1 ~0.10). This indicates that the decision boundary between \"Fraud\" and \"Legit\" is highly non-linear, especially after introducing synthetic SMOTE examples, which linear models cannot easily separate."
