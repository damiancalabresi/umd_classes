Project 3: Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices (Difficulty: 3)

Project Objective: Create a forecasting model to predict future stock prices based on historical data, optimizing for mean absolute error (MAE).

Dataset Suggestions: Utilize the "S&P 500 Stock Prices" dataset available on Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) and download historical daily prices.

Tasks:

Data Collection: Fetch historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API.
Data Preparation: Preprocess the data for time series analysis (handling missing values, scaling).
Model Training: Implement Fastai's time series capabilities to build a forecasting model (e.g., LSTM).
Feature Engineering: Create additional features such as moving averages and lagged variables to improve predictions.
Evaluation: Assess the model's forecasting accuracy using MAE and visualize predictions against actual stock prices.
Advanced Techniques: Experiment with ensemble methods or hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Bonus Ideas:

For Project 3, integrate external data sources (e.g., news sentiment analysis) to enhance forecasting accuracy.
