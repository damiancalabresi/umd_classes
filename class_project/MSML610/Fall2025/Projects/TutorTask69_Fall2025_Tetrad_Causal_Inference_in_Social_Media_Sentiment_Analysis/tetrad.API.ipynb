    "# Introduction to Tetrad\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetrad is a Java library of various interfaces for exploring causal explanations of data. With the py-tetrad python interface and JPype, we can access all of Tetrad's functionality, from creating graphs of relationships within data to simulating data from constructed models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Java JDK 21+ installed on your system\n",
    "- Python 3.12+\n",
    "- py-tetrad for basic Tetrad functionality\n",
    "- JPype for basic and extended Tetrad functionality\n",
    "- PyTorch for the CausalPerceptronNetwork, used to simulate data from existing graphs"
