TL;DR: Welcome to our new blog where we'll share insights on AI research,
machine learning, software engineering, and our experiences in academia and
industry.

<!-- more -->

We're excited to launch this blog as a platform to share our thoughts, research
findings, and experiences in artificial intelligence and software engineering.
As researchers and practitioners, we've had the opportunity to work on
challenging problems in machine learning, causal inference, and time series
analysis.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics including:

- **AI Research**: Deep dives into machine learning algorithms, causal inference
  methods, and time series forecasting
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, tools, and techniques for building
  robust ML systems
- **Teaching**: Insights from teaching courses on machine learning and AI
- **Startup Experience**: Lessons learned from working on real-world AI
  applications

## My Background

I'm an Adjunct Professor at the University of Maryland, teaching and conducting
research in AI and machine learning. My research interests span causal
inference, time series analysis, and applying machine learning to real-world
problems. I also have extensive experience in software engineering, having
worked on large-scale ML systems and open-source projects.

## Why This Blog

The goal of this blog is to share knowledge and insights that might be useful
to:

- **Researchers**: Looking for practical perspectives on implementing and
  deploying ML models
- **Engineers**: Interested in understanding the theory behind ML algorithms
- **Students**: Learning about AI and software engineering
