TL;DR: Welcome to my new blog where I'll share insights on AI research, machine learning, software engineering, and my experiences in academia and startups.

<!-- more -->

I'm excited to launch this blog as a platform to share my thoughts, research findings, and experiences in artificial intelligence and software engineering. As both a researcher and practitioner, I've had the opportunity to work on challenging problems in machine learning, causal inference, and time series analysis.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics including:

- **AI Research**: Deep dives into machine learning algorithms, causal inference methods, and time series forecasting
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, tools, and techniques for building robust ML systems
- **Teaching**: Insights from teaching courses on machine learning and AI
- **Startup Experience**: Lessons learned from working on real-world AI applications

## My Background

I'm an Adjunct Professor at the University of Maryland, teaching and conducting research in AI and machine learning. My research interests span causal inference, time series analysis, and applying machine learning to real-world problems. I also have extensive experience in software engineering, having worked on large-scale ML systems and open-source projects.

## Why This Blog

The goal of this blog is to share knowledge and insights that might be useful to:

- **Researchers**: Looking for practical perspectives on implementing and deploying ML models
- **Engineers**: Interested in understanding the theory behind ML algorithms
- **Students**: Learning about AI and software engineering
- **Practitioners**: Applying ML in industry settings
