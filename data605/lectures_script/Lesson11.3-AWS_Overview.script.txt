# ##############################################################################
# Intro
# ##############################################################################

In this lesson, we will discuss Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a pivotal cloud
platform, exploring its services, business model, and capabilities. We'll cover
cloud computing types, compare major providers, examine AWS's infrastructure and
pricing, and highlight best practices for security and management, culminating
in practical applications for businesses.

# ##############################################################################
# Amazon Web Services (AWS)
# ##############################################################################

AWS is a comprehensive cloud platform that provides a wide range of services. It
offers computing power through services like EC2, storage solutions like S3, and
networking capabilities. AWS provides different levels of abstraction, such as
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software
as a Service (SaaS). This means we can use AWS for various purposes, from
hosting websites to running enterprise software and machine learning
applications. We can control AWS services using a web interface, command-line
interface, or language-specific libraries like Python's boto3.

Let's now explore AWS as a business entity.

# ##############################################################################
# AWS as Business
# ##############################################################################

AWS operates on a pay-per-use pricing model, introducing around 500 new services
and features each year. It has data centers spread across the globe, including
regions in the US, Europe, Asia, and South America. AWS is highly profitable,
generating $91 billion in revenue annually as of 2023, with a growth rate of 42%
year-over-year. It holds a significant share of the cloud market, controlling
30% of the business.

Next, we'll discuss the different types of cloud computing.

# ##############################################################################
# Types of Cloud Computing
# ##############################################################################

Cloud computing allows us to access a shared pool of configurable computing
resources, such as servers, storage, networks, applications, and services, from
anywhere. It's convenient and available on-demand. There are three main types of
clouds: public, private, and hybrid. Public clouds, like AWS, are open to the
general public. Private clouds are used within a single organization, such as
government entities. Hybrid clouds combine elements of both public and private
clouds, offering flexibility and scalability.

# ##############################################################################
# AWS vs Google Cloud vs Microsoft Azure
# ##############################################################################

Let's compare the three major cloud service providers: AWS, Google Cloud, and
Microsoft Azure. They all have a global infrastructure and offer similar
services like computing, networking, and storage. For instance, AWS has EC2,
Google Cloud has Compute Engine, and Azure provides VMs. They also use a
pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means you only pay for what you use. However,
there are differences. AWS is the market leader and is known for its maturity
and power, using open-source technologies. Azure is great for those who use
Microsoft products, while Google Cloud is ideal for cloud-native applications.

Now, let's explore how businesses can transition from on-premise to the cloud
using AWS.

# ##############################################################################
# From On-premise to AWS: 1/3
# ##############################################################################

Cloud transformation involves migrating systems to the cloud, like moving a
medium-sized e-commerce site from on-premise to AWS. Traditionally, a web server
handles requests, a database stores data, and a CDN delivers static content to
reduce server load. Dynamic content, such as HTML pages, is served by the web
server. This setup is effective on-premise but can be optimized in the cloud In
the cloud, the same architecture can be relocated to AWS, with the web server,
database, and content delivery managed through AWS services. This shift
leverages cloud computing's scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness
while maintaining the existing system's structure. It allows businesses to focus
on growth rather than managing physical infrastructure Designing for the cloud
requires considering components like DNS, databases, and object storage such as
S3. Managed solutions simplify operations. Using multiple smaller virtual
services with a load balancer enhances reliability by distributing traffic
evenly, ensuring service availability even if one part fails

Transition: Now, let's explore how AWS helps us manage capacity efficiently.

# ##############################################################################
# Capacity Scaling
# ##############################################################################

With AWS, we don't need to predict or plan for capacity in advance. We can
schedule capacity on-the-fly, which means we don't have to worry about physical
constraints like rack space or power supplies. We can easily add more virtual
machines and storage as needed, scaling from 1 to 1000 VMs or from gigabytes to
petabytes of storage. This flexibility allows us to handle seasonal traffic
variations, such as differences between day and night or weekdays and weekends,
without maintaining a test system when the team is off.

Transition: Next, we'll discuss how AWS's global presence benefits us.

# ##############################################################################
# Worldwide Presence
# ##############################################################################

AWS's extensive network of data centers allows us to deploy applications close
to our customers, improving performance and reducing latency. This worldwide
presence ensures that our applications can reach users quickly, no matter where
they are located.

Transition: Let's move on to the cost structure of AWS services.

# ##############################################################################
# Pay-per-use
# ##############################################################################

AWS operates on a pay-per-use model, similar to an electric bill. We are billed
based on our usage, including the hours our virtual servers run, the storage we
use, and the data traffic we generate. This model allows us to pay only for what
we use, making it cost-effective.

Transition: Finally, let's look at AWS's free tier offerings.

# ##############################################################################
# Free Tier
# ##############################################################################

AWS offers a free tier that allows us to use certain services for free for 12
months after signing up. This is a great opportunity to experiment with services
like EC2 and S3. However, if we exceed the free tier limits, we will start
incurring charges, so it's important to set an alarm to avoid unexpected costs.

# ##############################################################################
# Pay-per-use
# ##############################################################################

Let's discuss the advantages of the pay-per-use model. This approach means we
don't need to make big investments upfront or commit to long-term expenses. It
helps us start projects with lower costs, making it easier to manage our budget.
We can also break down our system into smaller parts without worrying about
extra costs. For example, using one big server or two smaller ones costs the
same. Additionally, this model offers affordable fault tolerance and high
performance. We can scale our workload efficiently, like using one server for
1000 hours or 1000 servers for one hour, depending on our needs.

Transition: Now, let's explore how we can interact with AWS effectively.

# ##############################################################################
# Interacting with AWS
# ##############################################################################

We have several ways to interact with AWS. The Management Console, a graphical
user interface, allows us to start using services easily and set up cloud
infrastructure for development and testing. The Command-line tool (CLI) helps us
manage and access AWS services, and we can automate tasks that we do repeatedly.
SDKs provide libraries in various programming languages to interact with AWS,
making it easy to integrate our applications. For instance, we can use `boto3`
for Python. Blueprints let us describe our system with all its services and
dependencies, focusing on what the system should be, not how to build it.

Transition: Next, let's look at managing accounts and users in AWS.

# ##############################################################################
# Accounts and Users
# ##############################################################################

In AWS, we start with one root account and can attach multiple users to it. Each
user can have different privileges, which helps us isolate workloads
effectively. It's important to be safe by never using the root account for
development, always enabling two-factor authentication, and avoiding costly
mistakes. When accessing a virtual server, we create a key pair. The public key
is stored in AWS and on virtual servers, while the private key is our secret. We
must keep it safe because if we lose it, we can't retrieve it.

# ##############################################################################
# Create User Account
# ##############################################################################

Let's discuss the importance of creating a new user account for development
purposes. It's crucial not to use the AWS root account for development tasks.
Instead, we should use IAM, which stands for Identity and Access Management, to
create a new user. This user will have an access key ID and a secret access key.
For access control, we should enable both programmatic and console access. It's
also important to limit user actions through policies to ensure security and
proper management of resources.

Transition: Now, let's move on to understanding AWS Virtual Machines.

# ##############################################################################
# AWS VMs
# ##############################################################################

AWS uses virtualization to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same
hardware, allowing us to start and stop VMs as needed. The physical server, also
known as the host machine or bare metal, includes CPUs, memory, networking
interfaces, and storage. The hypervisor, which is a combination of software and
CPU hardware, isolates guest VMs and manages hardware requests. AWS initially
used the Xen hypervisor but has switched to AWS Nitro for hardware-assisted
virtualization, offering performance close to bare metal. Virtual servers are
isolated yet share the same hardware.

Transition: Next, let's explore how to select the right region for our AWS
resources.

# ##############################################################################
# Select Region
# ##############################################################################

When selecting a region, such as `us-east-1`, it's important to consider the
location and infrastructure. For example, `us-east-1` is located at 21155 Smith
Switch Road, Ashburn, VA, USA, which is a major internet backbone. This area
hosts several data centers, including Equinix, Digital Realty, Vantage Data
Centers, and H5 Data Centers. Choosing the right region can impact latency, data
sovereignty, and compliance, so it's crucial to select a region that aligns with
our needs and requirements.

# ##############################################################################
# Starting an EC2 Instance
# ##############################################################################

Let's start by selecting the operating system for our EC2 instance using an
Amazon Machine Image (AMI). This image includes the operating system and any
pre-installed software, saving us time on setup. Next, we choose the instance
parameters, such as the instance type like `t2.micro`, which we'll discuss more
later. Finally, we configure the instance by setting up the network, shutdown
behavior, termination protection, and monitoring options. This setup ensures our
instance is ready to use and meets our specific needs.

Now, let's explore the different AWS instance types available.

AWS offers various instance types, each designed for different computing needs.
The instance type determines the computing power available. We have different
instance families like `T` for cost-effective options, `M` for general purposes,
`C` for compute-optimized tasks.

AWS pricing is complex due to factors like burst mode, vCPUs, multi-tenancy, and
purchasing options such as on-demand, spot, reserved, and pre-paid instances. In
2023, there are 642 EC2 machine types. The cheapest costs about 37 USD annually,
while the most expensive can reach 1.91 million USD per year, offering 500 CPUs
and 24TB of memory. To track prices more effectively, sites like
instances.vantage.sh are useful

Let's discuss the steps to start an EC2 instance. First, we need to add storage
by selecting the volume size and type, either SSD or magnetic HDDs. Tagging the
instance helps in identifying it later. Configuring the firewall is crucial for
security, allowing access via SSH and selecting a key-pair for authentication.
Monitoring the instance can be done using tools like CloudWatch, which helps
track performance and usage.

After setting up, we start the instance and find its public IP address. This IP
is essential for connecting to the machine. To connect, we use SSH with a
command line, specifying the key file and the public IP.

With the instance running, let's explore the different states a virtual machine
can be in.

# ##############################################################################
# States of a VM
# ##############################################################################

Virtual machines can be in several states. Starting a stopped VM gets it running
again. When stopped, the VM isn't billed, but network HDDs persist and incur
charges, while local disks do not persist. Rebooting keeps network HDDs intact,
but local disks don't persist, and the VM might restart on a different host.
Terminating a VM deletes it permanently, with network HDDs persisting but local
disks wiped out. Understanding these states helps manage costs and data
effectively.

# ##############################################################################
# Moving / Upgrading EC2 Instances
# ##############################################################################

Let's discuss how we can scale our EC2 instances. Scaling up or down involves
changing the virtual machine size to adjust computing power. We need to stop the
VM, change the instance type, and then start it again, keeping in mind that IP
addresses will change. AWS regions are groups of independent data centers, and
data doesn't transfer across them. Some services are global, like IAM and CDN.
Moving across regions can bring us closer to users, meet compliance needs,
ensure service availability, provide redundancy, and manage costs, which vary by
region.

Transition: Now, let's explore how we can optimize costs with different EC2
options.

# ##############################################################################
# Optimizing Costs
# ##############################################################################

We have several options to manage costs effectively. On-demand instances offer
maximum flexibility, allowing us to start and stop VMs anytime and pay by the
hour. EC2 and Compute saving plans require a commitment of one or three years,
with payment options that can be all, partial, or no upfront, offering discounts
up to three times cheaper than on-demand. Capacity reservations ensure access to
machines even during peak hours. Spot instances let us bid for unused capacity,
with prices based on supply and demand, offering discounts up to ten times
cheaper than on-demand, ideal for asynchronous tasks.

Transition: Let's dive into how we can achieve low-cost processing for batch
jobs.

# ##############################################################################
# Low-Cost Processing
# ##############################################################################

Many batch jobs are not critical and run on a schedule, like daily data analysis
or generating reports from a database. We can allocate machines on demand, as
AWS bills VMs per minute, meaning we only pay when jobs are running. AWS Batch
offers spare capacity at a discount, running jobs when capacity is available,
saving us 50%. AWS Lambda provides a serverless option, allowing us to execute
code without managing servers, which can be cost-effective for certain tasks.

# ##############################################################################
# Programming the Infrastructure
# ##############################################################################

Let's discuss how AWS allows us to control everything through an API. This means
we can start a virtual machine, create storage, or even launch a Hadoop cluster
using different methods. We can use the AWS GUI console, make HTTP requests to
the API, use the command line interface, or call the API from code using a
software development kit. CloudFormation lets us describe the infrastructure
state with templates, which are then translated into API calls. Jeff Bezos's
2002 API mandate was a game-changer, leading to significant financial success
for AWS.

Transition: Now, let's explore how we can manage infrastructure using code.

# ##############################################################################
# Infrastructure-as-Code
# ##############################################################################

We can use high-level programming languages to control IT systems, applying
software development principles like code repositories, automated tests, and
continuous integration. DevOps, or SRE at Google, combines developers and
operations into one team. This approach encourages using software to bridge the
gap between development and operations. By switching roles, developers and
operations staff can understand each other's challenges, fostering better
communication and collaboration.

Transition: Let's look at the advantages of using infrastructure-as-code.

# ##############################################################################
# Infrastructure-as-Code: Advantages
# ##############################################################################

Using infrastructure-as-code saves time by allowing us to reuse scripts and
automate tasks, reducing the need for repetitive actions. It also minimizes
mistakes with a push-button flow and ensures consistency with multiple
deployments per day. The deployment pipeline involves committing changes,
building applications, running tests, and propagating changes to production.
Scripts serve as detailed documentation, explaining what actions are taken and
how, though not necessarily why. This approach streamlines processes and
enhances efficiency in managing IT infrastructure.

# ##############################################################################
# AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
# ##############################################################################

The AWS CLI offers a unified interface to interact with all AWS services via the
command line, outputting results in an easy-to-read and process JSON format

The AWS SDK is a library enabling AWS API calls from languages like Python, Go,
C++, and JavaScript. It simplifies tasks by managing authentication, error
retries, HTTPS communication, and XML/JSON serialization. It uses an imperative
approach, requiring detailed instructions and self-managed dependencies. Despite
these challenges, the SDK is a powerful tool for integrating AWS services into
applications

AWS CloudFormation enables infrastructure description via JSON or YAML
templates. This declarative method specifies the desired system state, not the
steps to reach it. CloudFormation uses AWS Stacks to process these templates.
Benefits include consistent infrastructure descriptions, dependency management,
and parameter-based customization. Infrastructure can be tested by creating it
from a template, running tests, and then shutting it down. Updates are simple;
template changes are automatically applied by Stacks. Moreover, CloudFormation
templates act as documentation and can be stored in source control

# ##############################################################################
# Securing Your System
# ##############################################################################

Let's discuss how to keep our systems secure. First, always install software
updates to fix security vulnerabilities as they arise. This is crucial for
maintaining a secure environment. Next, restrict access to your AWS account by
using separate accounts for individuals and scripts, and apply the "least
privilege" principle to grant only necessary permissions. For network security,
open only essential ports like 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, and ensure all
other ports are closed. Encrypting traffic and data is also vital. Lastly,
create a private network using subnets that are not accessible from the Internet
to further protect your system.

Now, let's move on to understanding the shared responsibility model with AWS.

# ##############################################################################
# AWS Shared-responsibility Principle
# ##############################################################################

In the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS takes care of certain security
aspects while we handle others. AWS is responsible for protecting the network by
monitoring Internet access and preventing DDoS attacks. They also ensure the
physical security of data centers and properly decommission storage devices
after their end of life. On our end, we need to restrict access using IAM,
encrypt network traffic with protocols like HTTPS, configure firewalls for VPNs,
encrypt data, and keep our operating systems and software updated. By
understanding and fulfilling our responsibilities, we can maintain a secure
cloud environment.

# ##############################################################################
# Outro
# ##############################################################################

In this lesson, we discussed Amazon Web Services (AWS), its business model,
cloud types, service comparisons, scaling options, pricing structures,
infrastructure management, and security models. We explored AWS's flexibility,
global presence, pay-per-use pricing, and the importance of
infrastructure-as-code for efficient cloud management.
