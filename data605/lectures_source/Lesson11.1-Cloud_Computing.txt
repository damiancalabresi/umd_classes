# Cloud Computing

* Cloud Computing
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- Computing as **"service" rather than "product"**
  - Storage and computing in the cloud
  - Edge devices (e.g., phones, laptops, tablets) interact with the cloud

:::: {.column width=35%}

- **Advantages of cloud computing**
  - Device agnostic: seamless computation across devices
  - On demand
  - Efficiency / scalability
    - Programming frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Dask) enable scalability
  - Reliability
  - Cost: "pay-as-you-go" for resources
    - Cheaper than building own systems
    - Computing as a commodity (like electricity)

* Buying infrastructure
- **To buy or to rent?**

- **Building / buying infrastructure**
  - Require time and capital investments (Capex)
    - Especially at the beginning without revenues
    - Smooth cash flow (constant $/mo) is better than lumpy one (big one-time
      purchase)
  - Buy hardware (e.g., computers, storage, network)
    - Estimate current hardware size
    - Difficult to estimate future demands
  - Update obsolete hardware
  - Cost of owning hardware (Opex)
    - Data center, electricity, cooling, handling faults
  - Administering
    - Install, update, maintain software stack

* Renting infrastructure
- **Renting infrastructure** (i.e., cloud computing)
  - Pay for what you use
    - Low initial capital investment
  - Ready systems with a click
  - No multi-year resource plan needed
  - Choose machines for your application and data needs

* Cloud Computing
::: columns
:::: {.column width=55%}
- **Ideas of cloud computing around for a long time**
  - Mainframes + thin clients (1960s)
  - Personal computers (1980s)
  - Grid computing for supercomputers (1990s)
  - Peer-to-peer architecture (early 2000s)
  - Client-server model (Web 1.0 and Web 2.0)
  - Cloud computing (2010s)

- **Now, it finally works**

- **Why now?**
  - A convergence of key technologies
    - OS virtualization
    - Large data centers
    - Decreasing hardware costs
    - Big data frameworks

* Infrastructure-as-a-Service
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- Cloud provides low-level resources
- Install and maintain OS and applications
- E.g.,
  - AWS EC2
  - Google Compute Engine

* Platform-as-a-Service
::: columns
:::: {.column width=70%}
- **Problem**: assembling your own software stack requires work
  - Install
  - Configure
  - Manage dependencies
  - Incompatible versions

- **Solution**: get a pre-built software stack
  - Pre-installed OS
  - Libraries
  - Application software
  - As a virtualization solution
    - E.g., VMware or Docker
    - Software stack as a large file with system image
    - **Business model built around this**
  - E.g., pre-built images for Hadoop
    - Hortonworks, Cloudera
  - E.g., pre-built distributions for Linux
    - RedHat, Gentoo, CentOS

- Cloud provides OS and programming languages
  - Build application on top of it
  - E.g.,
    - Google App Engine
    - Managed Hadoop

* Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
::: columns
:::: {.column width=70%}
- **Cloud provides the application**
  - No need to install on your machine
  - Use directly from the cloud
  - Examples include:
    - _Dropbox_: Access and share files without local storage
    - _Salesforce_: Manage customer relationships online
    - Any app running in a browser: Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365

- **Benefits**
  - Accessibility from any device with internet connectivity
  - Automatic updates and maintenance by the provider
  - Scalability for growing user needs
  - Cost-effectiveness by reducing physical hardware and software installations

* X-as-a-Service
- After 2010, business model of **X-as-a-service (XaaS)**
  - Mobility-as-a-service (e.g., Uber)
  - Games-as-a-service (e.g., Google Stadia)
  - Storage-as-a-service (e.g., S3, Google Drive)
  - Desktop-as-a-service (e.g., AWS app)
  - Marketing-as-a-service
  - Banking-as-a-service
  - ...

* Cloud Deployment Models
::: columns
:::: {.column width=70%}
- **Private**
  - Internal cloud hosted on organizational premises
  - E.g., company's data center running virtualized services

- **Public **
  - External cloud hosted by third-party providers
  - E.g., AWS, Azure, GCP offering compute and storage to clients

- Hybrid cloud
  - Combine private and public environments
  - Sensitive workloads stay internal
  - scalable tasks move to public cloud

- **On-premises resources**
  - E.g., corporate servers in a building

- **Off-premises resources**
  - Third-party cloud infrastructure
  - E.g., cloud provider's distributed data centers

- **Key idea**: Hybrid architectures optimize cost, security, scalability
