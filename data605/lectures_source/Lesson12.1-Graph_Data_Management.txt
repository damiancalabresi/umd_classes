## Motivation

* Graphs: Background
:::columns
::::{.column width=50%}
- A **graph** represents entities and their connections
  - Entities are _vertices_ (or nodes)
  - Connections are _edges_ (or links, arcs, relationships)

- **Applications in various fields**
  - Social networks
  - Biological networks
  - Information networks
  - Infrastructure networks

* Graph Data Structures: Motivation
:::columns

- Increasing interest in querying and reasoning about **graph data**

- **Sectors**
  - Healthcare
  - Finance
  - Logistics

- **Example applications**
  - Fraud detection
  - Recommendation systems
  - Network analysis

* Graph Data Structures: Motivation
:::columns
::::{.column width=50%}
- Increased data volumes and accessibility

- Traditional tools (e.g., relational DBs) struggle with graph queries
  - Dedicated solutions: Neo4j

- Existing tools inefficient for processing graph-structured queries
  - Dedicated solutions: Google Pregel, Apache Giraph, Spark GraphX

* Knowledge Graphs
- **Representation of knowledge in the form of graphs**
  - Capture entities, relationships, properties
  - Provide structured view of real-world information

- Represent using RDF or Property Graph models
  - E.g., Google Knowledge Graph, DBpedia, Wikidata

- **Applications**
  - Enable machine understanding of complex domains
  - Support semantic search, recommendation, analytics
  - Used in industries for data integration, knowledge discovery, AI
    applications

- **Ontologies**
  - Provide formal representation of knowledge
  - Promote interoperability across knowledge bases

* Graph Data Models: RDF
:::columns
::::{.column width=60%}
- **Resource Description Framework**
  - RDF uses triples subject-predicate-object
  - Connects "subject" and "object" through a "predicate"
  - E.g., "TomCruise-acted-TopGun"

- **Used to represent knowledge bases**
  - Queried through SPARQL

::::

- **Pros**
  - Standardization
    - W3C standard to model data
    - Subject and object can be URIs in semantic web
  - Interoperability
    - Merge RDF data stores
  - Extensibility
    - Add new nodes and relationships
    - Support ontologies

- **Example Use Cases**
  - Linking Open Data project
  - FOAF (Friend of a Friend) vocabulary

* Graph Data Models: Property Graph
:::columns
::::{.column width=45%}
- Directed graph with nodes and edges having key-values _properties_

- **No universal standard**
  - Similar expressive power to RDFs
  - Less "schema"
  - Harder to interoperate

- Examples of **query languages**:
  - Cypher (e.g., Neo4j)
  - Gremlin (e.g., Apache TinkerPop)

- **Applications** 
  - Used by many open-source graph data management tools
  - Logistics and supply chain management
  - Fraud detection in financial transactions

- Common data model for flexible data representation
- Directed labeled tree
- Popular for non-tabular data exchange

## Storing graph data

* Storing Graph Data
- **File systems**
  - Very simple
  - No support for transactions, ACID compliance
  - Minimal functionality (e.g., must build the analysis/querying on top)

- **Relational databases**
  - Mature technology
  - All the good stuff (SQL, transactions, ACID compliance, toolchains)
  - Minimal functionality for graph data

- **NoSQL key-value stores**
  - Can handle very large datasets efficiently in a distributed fashion
  - Minimal native functionality for graph data

- **Graph databases**
  - Efficiently support complex queries/tasks (e.g., graph traversals)
  - Not as mature as RDBMSs
  - Often lack declarative language similar to SQL
    - You may need to write custom programs

* Graph Databases
- Many specialized graph database systems
  - E.g., Neo4j, Titan, OrientDB, AllegroGraph

- Key distinctions from relational databases
  - Manage and query graph-structured data
  - Store graph structure explicitly with pointers
    - Avoid joins, simplify graph traversals
    - Natural to write _queries_ and _graph algorithms_ (reachability, shortest
      paths)
  - Support graph query languages: SPARQL, Cypher, Gremlin
  - Rudimentary declarative interfaces
  - Applications often require programmatic interfaces
  - Provide programmatic API for arbitrary graph algorithms
