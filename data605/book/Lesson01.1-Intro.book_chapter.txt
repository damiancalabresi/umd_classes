</center>

<center>

![](data605/book/Lesson01.1-Intro.png/slides002.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Invariants of a class lecture**
  - _Focus on intuition_: The goal here is to ensure that students grasp the
    fundamental concepts and underlying principles of the subject matter.
    Instead of just memorizing facts, students are encouraged to understand the
    'why' and 'how' behind the concepts.
  - _Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials_: These are hands-on coding
    exercises that allow students to apply what they've learned in a practical
    setting. Jupyter notebooks are particularly useful because they combine
    code, visualizations, and narrative text in one place.
    - _Tutorials done at home_: Students are expected to complete these
      tutorials outside of class time, allowing them to learn at their own pace
      and revisit challenging sections as needed.
    - _Videos added over time_: Supplementary videos are provided to enhance
      understanding. These might include walkthroughs of the tutorials or
      additional explanations of complex topics.

- **Class flow**
  - The class alternates between different teaching methods: slides for
    structured information, whiteboard for dynamic explanations and
    problem-solving, and tutorials for hands-on practice. This varied approach
    caters to different learning styles and keeps the class engaging.

- **Labs**
  - _Review complete class project examples_: Students examine full project
    examples to understand how individual concepts come together in a
    comprehensive application. This helps in visualizing the end goal of their
    learning.
  - _Collaborate on class project_: Students work together on a class project,
    fostering teamwork and allowing them to learn from each other. Collaboration
    also mirrors real-world scenarios where teamwork is essential.

# 3 / 10: Books of the Class

</center>

<center>

![](data605/book/Lesson01.1-Intro.png/slides003.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Slides**
  - **Are extracted from books, technical articles, Internet**: The slides used
    in this class are compiled from a variety of sources, including textbooks,
    scholarly articles, and online resources. This approach ensures that the
    information presented is comprehensive and up-to-date. By drawing from
    multiple sources, the slides provide a well-rounded perspective on the
    topics covered in the course.
  - **Aim to be self-sufficient**: The slides are designed to be complete and
    understandable on their own. This means that even if you miss a lecture or
    need to review the material later, the slides should provide enough
    information to grasp the key concepts. They are structured to include
    definitions, explanations, and examples, making them a valuable resource for
    studying and revising the course material.

- **Images**: The images shown on the slide are likely covers or relevant pages
  from textbooks or articles used in the course. These visuals help to identify
  the primary sources of information and may also serve as a reference for
  further reading. By including these images, the slide emphasizes the
  importance of these texts in understanding the course content.

</center>

- **Model and reason about data**
  - This outcome focuses on understanding how to create models that represent
    data accurately. It involves analyzing data to draw meaningful conclusions
    and make informed decisions. This skill is foundational in data science and
    machine learning, as it helps in understanding the underlying patterns and
    relationships within data.

- **Process and manipulate data**
  - This involves using tools like _Python_ and _Pandas_ to clean, transform,
    and prepare data for analysis. These tools are essential for handling large
    datasets efficiently, allowing you to perform operations such as filtering,
    aggregating, and reshaping data.

- **Introduce a variety of data models**
  - Understanding different data models, such as relational databases, NoSQL,
    and graph databases, is crucial. Each model has its strengths and is suited
    for specific types of applications. For example, relational databases are
    great for structured data, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data.

- **Use data management systems**
  - This involves learning how to use systems like _PostgreSQL_, _MongoDB_, and
    _HBase_ to store and retrieve data. Choosing the right system depends on the
    specific needs of your application, such as the type of data, scalability
    requirements, and query complexity.

- **Build data processing pipelines**
  - Tools like _Docker_ and _Airflow_ are used to automate and manage data
    workflows. Building pipelines helps in efficiently processing data from raw
    input to final output, ensuring that data is consistently and reliably
    transformed and analyzed.

- **Build a big-data system end-to-end**
  - This is a practical application of the skills learned, where you will either
    work on a class project or contribute to an open-source project. It involves
    designing, implementing, and deploying a complete big-data system, providing
    hands-on experience in managing large-scale data processing tasks.
