## The Foundations of AI
## #############################################################################

* AI Relates to Many Other Disciplines

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((AI))
    Philosophy
    Mathematics
    Economics
    Neuroscience
    Psychology
    Computer engineering
    Control theory
    Linguistics
```

* AI and Philosophy (1/2)

- **\black{Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?}**
  - **Reasoning**
    - Logic studies rules of proper reasoning
    - Aristotle (400 BCE) formulated laws governing the rational mind
    - Machines were built for arithmetic operations (e.g., Pascaline, 1600)
  - **Rationalism**
    - Use reasoning to understand the world

- **\black{How does the mind arise from a physical brain?}**
  - **Dualism**
    - Nature follows physical laws
    - Part of the human mind ("the soul") is exempt from physical laws
  - **Materialism**
    - The mind is a physical system, following the laws of physics
    - Where is free will? Free will is the perception of available choices

* AI and Philosophy (2/2)

::: columns
:::: {.column width=75%}
- **\black{What does knowledge come from?}**
  - **Empiricism**
    - Knowledge acquired via senses
    - E.g., learn that trees are green by looking at them
  - **Induction**
    - General rules from associations
    - E.g., many swans are white, infer all swans are white
  - **Logical Positivism**
    - Knowledge as logical theories linked to observations
    - E.g., scientific hypotheses connected to experimental data

- **\black{How does knowledge lead to action?}**
  - **Utilitarianism**
    - Actions justified by logic connecting goals and outcomes
  - **Consequentialism**
    - Right or wrong determined by action's expected outcomes
    - E.g., "If you kill, you will go to jail"
  - **Deontological ethics**
    - "Right actions" based on universal laws, not outcomes
    - E.g., "don't kill", "don't lie"

* AI and Cognitive Psychology

- **\black{How do humans think and act?}**
  - **Cognitive psychology**
    - Brain is an information-processing device
    - Stimuli translated into internal representation
    - Representation manipulated by cognitive processes to derive new internal
      representations ("beliefs")
    - Representations turned into actions ("goals")
  - **Cognitive science**
    - Use computer models to address memory, language, and logic thinking
    - Dual / opposite of AI
  - **Human-computer interaction**
    - Computers augment human abilities
    - From artificial intelligence (AI) to intelligence augmentation (IA)

* AI and Mathematics

- **\black{What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?}**
  - **Formal logic**
    - Logical deduction rules (Boole, 1850)
    - First-order logic includes objects and relations (Frege, 1879)
  - **Limits to deduction**
    - Some statements are "undecidable"
    - Incompleteness theorem: in any formal theory true statements exist that
      cannot be proved (Godel, 1931)

- **\black{How do we reason with uncertain information?}**
  - **Probability**
    - Mathematics of uncertainty
    - Cardano, Pascal, Bernoulli, Bayes (1500-1700)
  - **Statistics**
    - Combines data with probability
    - E.g., experiment design, data analysis, hypothesis testing, asymptotics

* AI and Economics (1/2)

- **\black{How to make decisions to maximize payoff given preferences?}**
  - **Economies**
    - Agents maximize economic well-being (utility)
    - Studies desires and preferences
  - **Decision theory**
    - Making decisions under uncertainty for preferred outcomes
    - Probability theory + utility theory
    - E.g., investment choices, policy decisions

- **\black{How to make decisions when payoffs are result of several actions?}**
  - **Operations research**
    - Make rational decisions with payoffs for sequence of actions (Bellman, 1957)
    - E.g., Markov Decision Processes
  - **Satisficing**
    - Decisions that are good enough
    - Closer to human behavior
    - E.g., choosing a restaurant that meets basic criteria rather than finding
      the perfect one

* AI and Economics (2/2)

- **\black{How multiple agents with different goals act?}**
  - **Large economies**
    - Many agents with no mutual impact
    - Ignore other agents' actions
    - E.g., national economy where individual actions don't affect market
  - **Small economies**
    - One player's actions influence others' utility
    - E.g., local market where one seller's pricing affects competitors
  - **Game theory**
    - Small economies resemble a "game" (Von Neumann, 1944)
    - Rational agents might need randomized strategies
    - E.g., rock-paper-scissors where randomization prevents predictability

* AI and Linguistics
- **\black{How can you create systems that understand natural language?}**
  - **Computational linguistics** (NLP)
    - Studies sentence structure and meaning
    - Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
    - Sentiment analysis in social media
    - Automated customer support chatbots

- **\black{How does language relate to thought?}**
  - **Knowledge representation**
    - How to represent knowledge for computer reasoning
    - E.g., first order knowledge, knowledge graphs

* AI and Neuroscience
::: columns
:::: {.column width=65%}
- **Brain**
  - Parts handle specific cognitive functions
  - Information processing in the cerebral cortex
  - E.g., frontal lobe injury may impair decision-making

- **Anatomy of the brain**
  - Composed of ~100 billion neurons
    - Each neuron connects with 10-100k others via synapses
    - Axons enable long-range connections
  - Signals propagate through electrochemical reactions
  - Short-term pathways support long-term connections (learning)

- **Memory**
  - No theory yet about individual memory storage
  - Current theory: memories reconstructed
