  tools and frameworks, such as algorithms and statistical models, that are
  essential for developing AI systems. Concepts like probability, calculus, and
  linear algebra are crucial for machine learning.

- **AI and Economics**: Economics contributes to AI through decision-making
  models and game theory. It helps in understanding how AI can optimize
  resources, predict market trends, and automate economic processes.

- **AI and Neuroscience**: Neuroscience inspires AI by providing insights into
  how the human brain processes information. This understanding helps in
  developing neural networks and other AI models that mimic human cognitive
  processes.

- **AI and Psychology**: Psychology offers insights into human behavior and
  cognition, which are essential for creating AI systems that interact naturally
  with humans. It helps in designing user-friendly interfaces and understanding
  user needs.

- **Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?**
  - **Reasoning**
    - Logic is the study of how we can make correct conclusions based on given
      information. It helps us understand what makes an argument valid or
      invalid.
    - Aristotle, a philosopher from ancient Greece, was one of the first to
      explore how humans think logically. He created some of the earliest rules
      for logical reasoning, which have influenced thinking for centuries.
    - Over time, humans have built machines to help with logical tasks, like
      doing math. One of the earliest examples is the Pascaline, a mechanical
      calculator from the 1600s. This shows our long-standing interest in using
      machines to assist with logical processes.
  - **Rationalism**
    - Rationalism is the belief that we can understand the world by using reason
      and logic. It suggests that our ability to think logically is key to
      gaining knowledge.

- **How does the mind arise from a physical brain?**
  - **Dualism**
    - Dualism is the idea that while the physical world follows certain laws,
      there is a part of the human mind, often referred to as "the soul," that
      operates beyond these laws. This suggests a separation between the mind
      and the physical body.
  - **Materialism**
    - Materialism argues that the mind is not separate from the body but is
      instead a physical system that operates according to the laws of physics.
      This view raises questions about concepts like free will, suggesting that
      what we perceive as free will might just be our awareness of different
      choices we can make.

</center>

- **What does knowledge come from?**
  - **Empiricism**
    - This is the idea that knowledge is gained through our senses. For example,
      we understand that trees are green because we see them with our eyes. This
      approach emphasizes observation and experience as the primary sources of
      knowledge.
  - **Induction**
    - Induction involves forming general rules based on specific observations.
      For instance, if you see many swans and they are all white, you might
      conclude that all swans are white. This method is about making broader
      generalizations from specific instances.
  - **Logical Positivism**
    - This philosophy suggests that knowledge should be based on logical
      theories that are closely tied to observations. For example, scientific
      hypotheses are considered valid when they can be tested and confirmed
      through experiments and data.

- **How does knowledge lead to action?**
  - **Utilitarianism**
    - Utilitarianism is about making decisions based on the logic that connects
      goals with outcomes. It suggests that actions are justified if they lead
      to the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
  - **Consequentialism**
    - This ethical theory determines the rightness or wrongness of actions based
      on their outcomes. For example, the statement "If you kill, you will go to
      jail" reflects the idea that the consequences of an action determine its
      moral value.
  - **Deontological ethics**
    - Deontological ethics focuses on the morality of actions themselves, rather
      than their outcomes. It is based on following universal laws or rules,
      such as "don't kill" or "don't lie," regardless of the consequences.

# 5 / 14: AI and Cognitive Psychology

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.2-The_Foundations_of_AI.png/slides005.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **How do humans think and act?**
  - **Cognitive psychology**
    - Cognitive psychology views the brain as an _information-processing
      device_. This means that just like a computer processes data, our brain
      processes information from the world around us.
    - When we encounter stimuli, such as sights or sounds, our brain translates
      these into _internal representations_. These are mental images or concepts
      that help us understand and interact with the world.
    - These internal representations are then manipulated by cognitive
      processes. This means our brain uses these representations to form new
      ideas or _beliefs_ about the world.
    - Finally, these representations can lead to actions, which are our _goals_.
      For example, if you believe it's going to rain, your goal might be to
      carry an umbrella.

  - **Cognitive science**
    - Cognitive science uses computer models to explore complex human abilities
      like memory, language, and logical thinking. These models help us
      understand how these processes work in the brain.
    - It is often seen as the _dual_ or _opposite_ of AI because while AI
      focuses on creating intelligent machines, cognitive science focuses on
      understanding human intelligence.

  - **Human-computer interaction**
    - This field studies how computers can _augment_ or enhance human abilities,
      making tasks easier or more efficient.
    - The shift from artificial intelligence (AI) to intelligence augmentation
      (IA) highlights the focus on using technology to support and enhance human
      capabilities, rather than just replicating them.

</center>

- **What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?**
  - **Formal logic**
    - _Logical deduction rules_ are the foundation of formal logic, which was
      significantly developed by George Boole in the mid-19th century. These
      rules help us derive conclusions from given premises in a structured way.
    - _First-order logic_ expands on basic logic by including objects and their
      relationships, a concept introduced by Gottlob Frege in 1879. This allows
      for more complex reasoning about the world.

  - **Limits to deduction**
    - Not all statements can be resolved through deduction; some are
      "undecidable," meaning we can't determine their truth or falsehood using
      existing rules.
    - Gödel's _Incompleteness Theorem_ tells us that in any sufficiently complex
      formal system, there are true statements that cannot be proven within the
      system. This was a groundbreaking discovery by Kurt Gödel in 1931, showing
      the inherent limitations of formal logic.

- **How do we reason with uncertain information?**
  - **Probability**
    - Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty. It
      provides a framework for quantifying and reasoning about the likelihood of
      different outcomes.
    - The development of probability theory involved contributions from several
      mathematicians, including Cardano, Pascal, Bernoulli, and Bayes, between
      the 1500s and 1700s.

  - **Statistics**
    - Statistics combines data with probability to make informed decisions and
      predictions. It involves designing experiments, analyzing data, testing
      hypotheses, and understanding long-term trends (asymptotics).
    - This field is crucial for interpreting data and drawing conclusions in the
      presence of uncertainty, making it a key tool in both scientific research
      and practical applications.

- **How to make decisions to maximize payoff given preferences?**
  - **Economies**
    - In economics, agents (like individuals or companies) aim to maximize their
      economic well-being, which is often referred to as _utility_. This means
      they make choices that they believe will give them the most satisfaction
      or benefit.
    - Economists study what people want and how they make choices based on these
      desires and preferences. This helps in understanding consumer behavior and
      market dynamics.
  - **Decision theory**
    - Decision theory is about making choices, especially when there is
      uncertainty involved. It combines probability theory (which deals with the
      likelihood of events) and utility theory (which deals with the
      satisfaction or benefit from outcomes).
    - This theory is applied in various fields, such as choosing where to invest
      money or deciding on government policies, where the outcomes are uncertain
      but preferences are clear.

- **How to make decisions when payoffs are result of several actions?**
  - **Operations research**
    - Operations research involves making rational decisions where the payoff
      depends on a sequence of actions. This concept was notably developed by
      Bellman in 1957 and is used to optimize complex processes.
    - An example is Markov Decision Processes, which help in planning and
      decision-making where outcomes are partly random and partly under the
      control of a decision-maker.
  - **Satisficing**
    - Satisficing is about making decisions that are "good enough" rather than
      perfect. This approach is more aligned with how humans often make
      decisions in real life.
    - For instance, when choosing a restaurant, instead of searching for the
      absolute best option, a person might pick one that meets their basic
      criteria, like being nearby and affordable. This reflects a practical
      approach to decision-making.

- **How multiple agents with different goals act?**
  - **Large economies**
    - In large economies, there are many agents, such as individuals or
      companies, each acting independently. Because there are so many
      participants, the actions of one agent typically do not have a noticeable
      impact on the overall market. This means that each agent can make
      decisions without needing to consider how others will react. For example,
      in a national economy, a single person's decision to buy or not buy a
      product is unlikely to affect the market price of that product.
  - **Small economies**
    - In contrast, small economies are characterized by fewer agents, where the
      actions of one can significantly influence the outcomes for others. Here,
      each player's decisions can affect the utility or satisfaction of others.
      For instance, in a local market, if one seller decides to lower their
      prices, it can directly impact the sales and pricing strategies of other
      sellers in the same market.
  - **Game theory**
    - Game theory is a framework for understanding strategic interactions in
      small economies, where the actions of one agent can affect others. It was
      formalized by John Von Neumann in 1944. In these scenarios, agents are
      considered rational and may need to use randomized strategies to avoid
      being predictable. A classic example is the game of rock-paper-scissors,
      where players use random choices to prevent their opponents from
      anticipating their next move. This concept helps in analyzing competitive
      situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple
      decision-makers.

- AI and Linguistics

* **How can you create systems that understand natural language?**
  - **Computational linguistics** (NLP)
    - This field focuses on how computers can be programmed to process and
      analyze large amounts of natural language data. It involves understanding
      both the structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics) of sentences.
    - _Machine translation_ is a key application, where systems like Google
      Translate convert text from one language to another. This requires
      understanding the nuances of both languages to provide accurate
      translations.
    - _Sentiment analysis_ is used to determine the emotional tone behind words,
      often applied to social media to gauge public opinion or customer
      feedback.
    - _Automated customer support chatbots_ use NLP to understand and respond to
      customer inquiries, providing quick and efficient service without human
      intervention.

* **How does language relate to thought?**
  - **Knowledge representation**
    - This concept deals with how information and relationships are structured
      so that computers can use them to simulate human reasoning and
      decision-making.
    - Examples include _first order knowledge_, which involves logical
      statements that can be used to infer new information, and _knowledge
      graphs_, which visually represent relationships between different pieces
      of information, helping systems understand context and make connections.

</center>

- **Brain**
  - The brain is a complex organ where different parts are responsible for
    specific cognitive functions. This means that certain areas of the brain are
    specialized for tasks like thinking, memory, and movement.
  - The cerebral cortex is a key area for processing information. It plays a
    crucial role in higher brain functions such as perception, reasoning, and
    decision-making.
  - For example, if someone suffers an injury to the frontal lobe, which is part
    of the cerebral cortex, they might have trouble making decisions or
    controlling their behavior.

- **Anatomy of the brain**
  - The brain is made up of approximately 100 billion neurons. Neurons are the
    basic building blocks of the brain and nervous system.
    - Each neuron can connect with between 10,000 to 100,000 other neurons
      through structures called synapses. This vast network allows for complex
      communication within the brain.
    - Axons are long, thread-like parts of a neuron that carry signals over long
      distances within the brain, facilitating communication between different
      brain regions.
  - Neurons communicate through electrochemical reactions, which are essential
    for transmitting signals throughout the brain.
  - Short-term pathways in the brain can develop into long-term connections,
    which is a fundamental process for learning and memory formation.

- **Memory**
  - Scientists have not yet developed a comprehensive theory about how
    individual memories are stored in the brain.
  - The prevailing theory suggests that memories are not stored as exact
    replicas but are reconstructed from various pieces of information when
    needed. This means that our recollection of events can be influenced by
    various factors and may not always be entirely accurate.

</center>

- **The Brain Causes the Mind**
  - **Simple cells lead to thought and consciousness**
    - The brain is made up of billions of simple cells called neurons. These
      neurons connect and communicate with each other, creating complex networks
      that give rise to thought and consciousness. This is truly amazing because
      it shows how simple building blocks can lead to incredibly complex
      processes.
    - These complex processes are what allow us to think, feel, and be aware of
      our surroundings. It's a reminder of how intricate and powerful the human
      brain is.

- **Supercomputers' complexity rivals the brain**
  - Modern supercomputers are incredibly complex and can perform calculations at
    speeds that rival the processing power of the human brain. However, while
    they can process data quickly, they don't yet replicate the nuanced and
    adaptable nature of human thought.

- **Brain-machine interface**
  - This technology allows the brain to communicate directly with external
    devices. Over time, the brain can adapt to these devices, allowing people to
    learn to use prosthetics as if they were natural limbs. This shows the
    brain's incredible ability to adjust and integrate new tools into its
    functioning.

- **AI singularity**
  - The AI singularity is a theoretical future point where artificial
    intelligence surpasses human intelligence. At this point, AI could
    potentially improve itself autonomously, leading to rapid advancements and
    the emergence of superintelligence.
    - This raises important questions about the societal impact of such a
      development. Ensuring that AI aligns with human values (known as the
      control problem or value alignment) is crucial to prevent unintended
      consequences.
    - Additionally, there could be significant economic and social disruptions
      due to increased automation, affecting jobs and industries.
  - Despite these discussions, achieving a level of intelligence comparable to
    the human brain remains a significant challenge and is still unknown.

</center>

- **What can be computed?**
  - **Algorithm**
    - An _algorithm_ is essentially a step-by-step procedure or formula for
      solving a problem. Think of it as a recipe that tells you exactly what
      steps to take to achieve a desired outcome. For example, the algorithm for
      computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) was devised by Euclid around
      300 BCE. This ancient algorithm is still used today to find the largest
      number that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder.
  - **Limits to computation**
    - The concept of a _Turing machine_, introduced by Alan Turing in 1936, is a
      foundational idea in computer science. It is a theoretical device that can
      simulate any algorithm's logic. However, not all problems can be solved by
      a Turing machine. Some functions are inherently non-computable, meaning no
      algorithm can solve them. A classic example is the _halting problem_,
      which asks whether a given program will eventually stop running or
      continue indefinitely. This problem is proven to be unsolvable by any
      algorithm.
  - **Tractability**
    - Tractability refers to how feasible it is to solve a problem within a
      reasonable amount of time. Problems are categorized into complexity
      classes based on how their solving time increases with input size.
      Polynomial complexity problems are generally considered tractable, as
      their solving time grows at a manageable rate. In contrast, problems with
      exponential complexity are often intractable, as their solving time
      increases rapidly with input size. The famous _P vs NP_ question asks
      whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (NP) can also
      be quickly solved (P). This is one of the most important open questions in
      computer science.

- AI and Control Theory

* **How can artifacts operate under their own control?**
  - **Control theory**
    - **Study self-regulating feedback control systems**
      - Control theory is all about understanding how systems can manage
        themselves without constant human intervention. It focuses on creating
        systems that can adjust their behavior based on feedback to maintain a
        desired state.
    - **E.g., a water regulator that maintains a constant water flow**
      - A simple example is a water regulator, which adjusts the flow of water
        to keep it steady, even if the pressure changes. This is a practical
        application of control theory in everyday life.
    - **Mechanisms to minimize error between current and goal states**
      - The goal of control systems is to reduce the difference between where
        the system is and where it should be. This involves continuously
        measuring performance and making adjustments.
    - **Kalman Filter (Kalman, 1960)**
      - The Kalman Filter is a mathematical tool used in control theory to
        predict and correct the state of a system. It helps in making accurate
        estimations by considering uncertainties and noise in the data.
    - **Based on calculus, matrix, stochastic optimal control**
      - Control theory uses advanced mathematics like calculus and matrices to
        model and solve problems. Stochastic optimal control deals with making
        the best decisions under uncertainty.
    - **AI: logical inference, symbolic planning, computation**
      - In AI, control theory principles are applied to enable machines to make
        decisions and plan actions logically. This involves using algorithms to
        simulate human-like reasoning and problem-solving.

- **How can we build an efficient computer?**
  - **Electronic computers**
    - These were first developed during World War II, marking the beginning of
      modern computing. They were large, room-sized machines that laid the
      groundwork for today's technology.
  - **Moore's Law**
    - This is an observation that the number of transistors on a microchip
      doubles approximately every 18 months, leading to a doubling of
      performance. This trend was consistent from 1970 to 2005. However, as
      chips became more densely packed, issues like heat and power consumption
      arose, prompting a shift from increasing clock speeds to developing
      multi-core processors.
  - **Hardware for AI**
    - _GPUs_ (Graphics Processing Units) and _TPUs_ (Tensor Processing Units)
      are specialized hardware designed to handle the massive computations
      required by AI applications. Wafer-scale engines are another innovation,
      providing even more computational power by integrating many processors on
      a single wafer.
  - **Current Trends**
    - Modern computing is moving towards massive parallelism, which mimics how
      the human brain processes information. This approach allows for more
      efficient processing of complex tasks. The pace of computing power
      advancement has accelerated, with significant improvements occurring every
      three months. In AI, GPUs and TPUs are crucial for deep learning tasks,
      and it has been found that high precision, such as 64-bit calculations, is
      often unnecessary for many AI applications.
  - **Quantum Computing**
    - This emerging technology holds the promise of dramatically speeding up
      certain types of computations. For example, Shor's algorithm, which is
      used for factoring large numbers, could be significantly accelerated by
      quantum computers, potentially impacting fields like cryptography.
