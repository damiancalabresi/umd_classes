- **ML, AI, and Intelligence**
  - **Machine Learning is a subset of AI**
    - Machine Learning (ML) is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Think of
      AI as the broad field that aims to create machines capable of performing
      tasks that would require human intelligence. ML is a specific approach
      within AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data and improve
      over time without being explicitly programmed.
    - It's common for people to confuse ML with other terms like deep learning,
      large-language models, and predictive analytics. Deep learning is a more
      advanced form of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze
      complex data. Large-language models, like GPT, are a type of deep learning
      model designed to understand and generate human language. Predictive
      analytics involves using data, statistical algorithms, and ML techniques
      to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.

* **What is artificial intelligence?**
  - Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of creating
    intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human
    intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language,
    recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI systems can
    be rule-based, where they follow specific instructions, or they can learn
    from data, as in the case of ML.

* **What is intelligence?**
  - Intelligence, in a general sense, refers to the ability to learn,
    understand, and apply knowledge to adapt to new situations and solve
    problems. In humans, intelligence encompasses a range of cognitive
    abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract
    thinking, and learning from experience. In the context of AI, intelligence
    is about creating systems that can mimic these human cognitive functions to
    some extent.

- **Human Intelligence**
  - **We call ourselves "homo sapiens" because intelligence sets us apart from
    animals**
    - Humans are known as _homo sapiens_, which translates to "wise man" in
      Latin. This name highlights the importance of intelligence in
      distinguishing humans from other species. Unlike animals, humans have
      developed complex languages, cultures, and technologies, all of which are
      rooted in our cognitive abilities.

  - **For thousands of years, we tried to understand how we think**
    - Throughout history, philosophers, scientists, and thinkers have been
      fascinated by the workings of the human mind. Understanding how we think
      and process information has been a central question in fields like
      philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. This quest has led to various
      theories and models attempting to explain human cognition.

  - **One of the biggest mysteries**
    - **Brain is a small mass of matter**
      - The human brain, despite its relatively small size and weight, is an
        incredibly complex organ. It consists of billions of neurons and
        connections, allowing it to perform a vast array of functions.
    - **Our brain can understand nature secrets, e.g., theory of relativity,
      quantum mechanics, black holes in the universe**
      - The brain's ability to comprehend and formulate complex scientific
        theories, such as Einstein's theory of relativity or the principles of
        quantum mechanics, is remarkable. These theories help us understand the
        universe's fundamental workings, showcasing the brain's extraordinary
        capacity for abstract thought and problem-solving.
    - **How can brain understand, predict, and manipulate a world more
      complicated than itself?**
      - This question highlights the paradox of human intelligence: how can a
        biological organ, limited in size and resources, grasp and manipulate
        concepts and phenomena that are vastly more complex than itself? This
        remains one of the most intriguing puzzles in the study of human
        cognition and intelligence.

</center>

- **Artificial Intelligence**
  - The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first introduced in 1956 during a
    conference at Dartmouth College. This marked the beginning of AI as a field
    of study. The goal was to explore the possibility of creating machines that
    could simulate aspects of human intelligence.

- **AI aims to:**
  - **Understand human intelligence:** AI research seeks to understand how human
    intelligence works by trying to replicate it in machines. This involves
    studying cognitive processes and how they can be modeled computationally.
  - **Create intelligent entities:** The ultimate goal of AI is to create
    machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence,
    such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.
  - The quote _"What I cannot create, I do not understand"_ by Richard Feynman
    emphasizes the idea that to truly understand something, one must be able to
    recreate it. This is a guiding principle in AI research.

- **AI is a technology**
  - AI is a versatile technology that can be applied to virtually any human
    activity or task, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. Its potential
    applications are vast and varied.
  - The impact of AI is considered to be greater than any previous technological
    advancement in history, as it has the potential to transform industries and
    societies on a global scale.
  - AI is already a significant economic force, generating trillions of dollars
    in revenue each year. This highlights its importance and the rapid pace of
    its development.
  - Despite its advancements, AI still faces many unresolved challenges. For
    example, while AI can solve specific problems, understanding and replicating
    the full scope of human intelligence remains a complex task. Additionally,
    AI could potentially contribute to solving major scientific problems, such
    as those in physics, by providing new insights and approaches.

# 5 / 19: AI Formal Definition

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides005.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **AI Formal Definition**
  - AI is defined around **two axes**:
    - **Thinking vs. Acting**: This axis differentiates between AI systems that
      focus on cognitive processes (thinking) and those that focus on behavior
      (acting).
    - **Human vs. Rational (ideal performance)**: This axis distinguishes
      between AI systems that aim to mimic human behavior and those that aim for
      optimal, logical performance, regardless of human-like characteristics.

  - Four possible definitions of AI as a machine that can:
    1. **Think humanly**: This involves creating machines that replicate human
       thought processes. It focuses on understanding and modeling how humans
       think.
    2. **Think rationally**: This involves machines that use logic and reasoning
       to solve problems, aiming for the most logical outcome.
    3. **Act humanly**: This involves machines that behave like humans, often
       evaluated through the Turing Test, which assesses a machine's ability to
       exhibit human-like behavior.
    4. **Act rationally**: This involves machines that make decisions and take
       actions that are logically optimal, aiming for the best possible outcome.

  - **Q**: Which one do you think is the best definition?
    - This question encourages reflection on the goals of AI development and
      which approach aligns best with those goals.

  - We will see that building machines that can **"act rationally"** should be
    the ultimate goal of AI
    - The emphasis here is on creating AI systems that make the best decisions
      based on available information, prioritizing logical and optimal outcomes
      over mimicking human behavior. This approach is often seen as the most
      practical and beneficial in real-world applications.

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides006.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **AI as Thinking Humanly**
  - The idea here is to create machines that can think in the same way humans
    do. This involves understanding the processes and mechanisms behind human
    thought. Essentially, it's about mimicking human cognitive processes in
    machines.

- **Pros**
  - By trying to replicate human thinking in machines, we can develop a precise
    theory of the human mind. This theory can be expressed as a computer
    program, which helps in understanding and simulating human cognition. It
    allows us to create models that can potentially predict human behavior and
    decision-making.

- **Cons**
  - One major challenge is that we don't fully understand how the human mind
    works. This lack of understanding makes it difficult to replicate human
    thought processes accurately in machines. Additionally, this approach is
    _anthropocentric_, meaning it is centered around human characteristics and
    may not consider other forms of intelligence or ways of thinking. This can
    limit the scope and applicability of AI systems.

</center>

- 2. AI as Thinking Rationally

* What are the rules of **correct thinking**?
  - The idea here is to understand how AI can be designed to think in a way that
    is logically sound. When we talk about _correct thinking_, we mean that if
    an AI system is given true information (premises), it should be able to
    process this information and come up with true conclusions. This is similar
    to how humans use logic to solve problems and make decisions.

* **Logic** studies the "laws of thought"
  - Logic is a branch of philosophy and mathematics that deals with the
    principles of valid reasoning. It involves creating formal systems to
    express statements about objects and their relationships. By using logic, we
    can ensure that the reasoning process is structured and follows specific
    rules, which helps in making sure that the conclusions drawn are valid.

* **Automatic theorem proving**
  - This is a field within AI where computer programs are designed to prove
    mathematical theorems automatically. These programs use logical notation to
    represent problems and attempt to solve them. However, a challenge arises
    because some problems might not have a solution, and the program could run
    indefinitely trying to find one. This is related to the _halting problem_,
    which is a concept in computer science that deals with determining whether a
    program will eventually stop running or continue indefinitely.

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides008.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Formalizing informal knowledge is difficult**
  - When we try to convert everyday actions or knowledge into a formal, logical
    structure, it becomes quite complex. For instance, consider the simple act
    of a handshake. In our daily lives, we understand this as a friendly gesture
    between two people. However, when we attempt to describe it using formal
    logic, it involves defining each step and condition, such as identifying two
    people, their hands, the movement towards each other, the contact, the
    shaking motion, and finally the release. This example illustrates how
    challenging it is to capture the nuances of informal knowledge in a rigid,
    logical framework.

- **Probabilistic nature of knowledge**
  - Many real-world situations involve uncertainty and cannot be described with
    absolute certainty. For example, in medicine, symptoms like fever, cough,
    and fatigue can be indicative of multiple illnesses such as the flu,
    COVID-19, or other conditions. This uncertainty requires a probabilistic
    approach to reasoning, where we assess the likelihood of various outcomes
    rather than relying on definitive logic.

- **Scalability challenges**
  - As problems grow in size and complexity, finding solutions using purely
    logical reasoning becomes impractical. In such cases, heuristics—rules of
    thumb or simplified strategies—are often employed to make the problem
    manageable. These heuristics help in finding good enough solutions within a
    reasonable time frame, even if they are not perfect.

- **Intelligence requires more than rational thinking**
  - While rational thinking is a crucial component of intelligence, it is not
    sufficient on its own. Intelligent agents, whether human or artificial, need
    to interact with the world to gather information and learn. This interaction
    highlights the importance of having a "body" or a means to perceive and act
    within an environment, which is essential for developing a comprehensive
    understanding and making informed decisions.

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides009.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Agent** is something that perceives and acts to reach a goal
  - An _agent_ in AI is essentially a system or entity that can observe its
    environment through sensors and act upon it using actuators to achieve
    specific objectives. This concept is fundamental in AI as it forms the basis
    for creating systems that can operate autonomously.

- **Definition**: AI designs **agents that can act like humans**
  - The goal of AI is to create agents that can mimic human behavior. This
    involves designing systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human
    intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing objects, and
    making decisions.

- **Turing test**
  - _"A computer passes the Turing test if a human cannot tell whether the
    answers to questions came from a person or a computer"_
  - The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing, is a measure of a machine's
    ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a
    human. If a machine can engage in a conversation with a human without the
    human realizing they are talking to a machine, it is said to have passed the
    test.

- Passing the (embodied) Turing test requires:
  1. **Natural language processing to communicate**
     - This involves the ability of a machine to understand and generate human
       language, allowing it to interact naturally with people.
  2. **Knowledge representation to store information**
     - AI systems need to store and organize information in a way that allows
       them to retrieve and use it effectively.
  3. **Automated reasoning to use stored knowledge and answer questions**
     - This is the capability of a system to apply logic and reasoning to the
       information it has to solve problems or answer questions.
  4. **Machine learning to detect patterns**
     - Machine learning enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns,
       and improve their performance over time without being explicitly
       programmed.
  5. **Computer vision and speech recognition to perceive objects and understand
     speech**
     - These technologies allow machines to interpret visual and auditory
       information from the world, similar to human senses.
  6. **Robotics to manipulate objects and move**
     - Robotics involves the design and use of robots that can physically
       interact with their environment, performing tasks that require movement
       and manipulation.

# 10 / 19: Turing Test: Pros and Cons

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides010.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Pros**
  - **Operational definition of intelligence**: The Turing Test provides a clear
    and practical way to measure machine intelligence. Instead of getting bogged
    down in complex theories, it offers a straightforward test: if a machine can
    engage in conversation indistinguishably from a human, it is considered
    intelligent.
  - **Sidestep philosophical vagueness**: The Turing Test helps avoid deep
    philosophical questions that are hard to answer, like "What is
    consciousness?" or "Can a machine think?" By focusing on observable
    behavior, it bypasses these debates and provides a more tangible goal for AI
    development.

- **Cons**
  - **Anthropomorphic criteria define intelligence in human terms**: The Turing
    Test assumes that human-like behavior is the only measure of intelligence.
    This is limiting because there are many forms of intelligence that don't
    resemble human thinking, such as animal intelligence or even unique machine
    intelligence.
  - **Intelligence in terms of Turing test is fooling humans into thinking it's
    human**: The test measures a machine's ability to mimic human conversation,
    which might not truly reflect its intelligence. It's more about deception
    than genuine understanding or problem-solving.
  - **E.g., aeronautical engineering is about**: This analogy highlights that
    just as aeronautical engineering focuses on principles like aerodynamics
    rather than mimicking birds, AI should focus on developing unique
    capabilities rather than just imitating human behavior.

</center>

</center>

- **Rational agents**: These are systems or entities designed to make decisions
  that are considered the "right" or most effective based on the information
  they have. The idea is that these agents should act in a way that maximizes
  their chances of success or achieving their goals.

- Agents that **act rationally** should:
  1. **Operate autonomously**: This means the agent should be able to function
     on its own without needing constant human intervention. It should make
     decisions independently.
  2. **Perceive environment**: The agent must be able to gather information from
     its surroundings. This could involve sensors, cameras, or other
     data-gathering tools that help it understand the context in which it
     operates.
  3. **Persist over a prolonged time period**: The agent should be able to
     continue functioning effectively over time, not just in short bursts. This
     involves maintaining performance and adapting as needed.
  4. **Adapt to change**: As the environment or circumstances change, the agent
     should be able to adjust its behavior or strategies to remain effective.
  5. **Create and pursue goals**: The agent should have the ability to set
     objectives and work towards achieving them, making decisions that align
     with these goals. This involves planning and prioritizing actions to reach
     desired outcomes.

# 12 / 19: Acting Rationally as Ultimate Goal of AI

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides012.png){width=80%}

</center>

- _Acting Rationally as Ultimate Goal of AI_: This slide discusses the ultimate
  aim of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is to act rationally. It highlights
  the importance of choosing the right definition of AI to guide its
  development.

- **Which definition of AI to use?**
  - _Acting vs. Thinking_: The slide contrasts two approaches to defining AI.
    Acting involves taking actions to achieve goals, while thinking focuses on
    the process of reasoning. The emphasis here is on the outcome (acting)
    rather than the process (thinking).
  - _Rational vs. Human_: This point compares rational behavior, which can be
    defined using mathematical models, with human behavior, which is influenced
    by evolutionary factors and may not always be rational.

- **Acting > Thinking**: The slide suggests that acting rationally encompasses
  more than just thinking rationally. It implies that the ability to make
  decisions and take actions is more comprehensive and practical than merely
  processing thoughts.

- **Rational > Human**: Rationality is preferred over mimicking human behavior
  because it can be precisely defined and measured. Human behavior, on the other
  hand, is complex and often irrational due to its evolutionary background.

- \*AI focuses on **agents acting rationally\***: The ultimate goal of AI is to
  create agents that can act rationally. This means they should be able to make
  decisions and take actions that are optimal or near-optimal in achieving their
  objectives, based on the information available to them.

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides013.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Rationality is Not Absolute**
  - **AI wants to build agents that do the right thing**
    - The goal of AI is to create systems that can make decisions that are
      considered "right" or appropriate. However, determining what the "right
      thing" is can be complex and context-dependent.

  - **E.g., you leave the house and a branch strikes you**
    - **Q**: Did you act rationally?
    - Probably. In this scenario, you couldn't predict or control the branch
      falling. Your decision to leave the house was rational based on the
      information available to you at the time.

  - **E.g., you cross the street and a car knocks you over**
    - **Q**: Did you act rationally?
    - It depends, but probably no. If you crossed without checking for traffic,
      it might be considered irrational. However, if you followed all safety
      rules and the car was at fault, your actions could still be rational.

  - **E.g., moral issues with self-driving car**
    - This example highlights the ethical dilemmas AI systems face. A
      self-driving car might have to choose between swerving to avoid a crash,
      potentially harming a pedestrian, or staying on course and risking the
      lives of its passengers. These situations challenge the notion of
      rationality, as the "right" decision can vary based on ethical
      perspectives and societal values.

# 14 / 19: Problems of a Rational Agent

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides014.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Probabilistic environment**
  - A _rational agent_ is an entity that makes decisions to achieve the best
    possible outcome. In a _deterministic setup_, where everything is
    predictable, the agent aims for the absolute best result. However, in
    real-world scenarios, uncertainty is common, so the agent strives for the
    best _expected_ outcome, which means making decisions that are likely to
    lead to the best results based on probabilities.

- **Best** is determined by the objective function:
  - The term "best" is subjective and depends on the _objective function_ used.
    This could be a _cost function_ (minimizing costs), a _sum of rewards_
    (maximizing benefits), a _loss function_ (minimizing errors), or _utility_
    (maximizing satisfaction or usefulness).

- Omniscience vs **no-regrets**
  - Omniscience implies having complete knowledge, which is rarely possible.
    Instead, agents aim for a _no-regrets_ approach, making the best decisions
    possible with the information available at the time.

- Sometimes **no provably correct action** exists
  - In many situations, there isn't a clear-cut correct action. Despite this,
    decisions still need to be made, often based on the best available evidence
    or predictions.

- Even **with perfect information** rationality can't be feasible due to:
  - Even if all information were available, it might not be practical to use it
    all. For example, in fields like medicine, gathering all possible data can
    be too costly or time-consuming. Additionally, processing this data might
    require more computational power than is feasible.

- Perfect good enough vs perfect
  - In many cases, aiming for "perfect" is unrealistic. Instead, agents often
    aim for "good enough," a concept known as _satisficing_. This means making
    decisions that are satisfactory and sufficient, rather than optimal, given
    the constraints.

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides015.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **Machine Learning: Definitions**

* **How to define machine learning?**
  - Machine learning is a branch of computer science focused on developing
    algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or
    decisions based on data. This means that instead of being programmed with
    specific instructions for every possible scenario, the computer can improve
    its performance over time by learning from examples.

* _"Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to
  learn without being explicitly programmed"_ (Samuel, 1959)
  - This classic definition by Arthur Samuel highlights the core idea of machine
    learning: enabling computers to learn from data and experiences rather than
    relying solely on pre-defined rules. This approach allows computers to adapt
    to new situations and improve their performance over time.

* **Machine learning** is about building machines to do **useful things**
  without being **explicitly programmed**
  - For example, a computer can learn to play checkers by playing against itself
    repeatedly. Through this process, it identifies and memorizes board
    positions that lead to winning outcomes, improving its strategy over time.

* _"A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some
  task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if $P(T)$ improves with experience
  $E$"_ (Mitchell, 1998)
  - Tom Mitchell's definition emphasizes the importance of experience in machine
    learning. A program is considered to be learning if its performance on a
    specific task improves as it gains more experience.

* **Examples of machine learning applications:**
  - _Computer vision_: Teaching computers to interpret and understand visual
    information from the world, such as recognizing objects in images.
  - _Speech recognition_: Enabling computers to understand and process human
    speech, allowing for applications like voice-activated assistants.
  - _Natural language processing_: Allowing computers to understand, interpret,
    and generate human language, which is crucial for applications like chatbots
    and translation services.

# 16 / 19: Limits of ML Compared to Human Intelligence

</center>

<center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides016.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **AI differs from human intelligence**
  - While both AI and humans can learn, the way they do it is quite different.
    For example, _Large Language Models (LLMs)_, which are a type of AI, learn
    patterns from vast amounts of text data, but they don't understand or learn
    in the same way humans do. Humans can learn from a few examples and apply
    reasoning, whereas AI relies heavily on data patterns.

- **Fragility to input variations**
  - Machine learning models can be surprisingly fragile. Even small changes in
    the input data can lead to significant errors. For instance, _adversarial
    attacks_ can trick a model into making mistakes by altering just a single
    pixel in an image. Similarly, a model trained to play a video game might
    fail if the screen is slightly rotated, while humans can easily adapt to
    such changes without any problem.

- **Lack of transfer learning**
  - Unlike humans, who can apply knowledge from one area to another, machine
    learning systems struggle with this. They typically need to be retrained
    from scratch when faced with a new domain or task, as they can't naturally
    transfer their learning across different contexts.

- **Massive data and compute requirements**
  - Machine learning models require a lot of data and computing power to learn
    effectively. For example, a teenager can learn to drive a car in just a few
    hours of practice. In contrast, self-driving car systems need to process
    vast amounts of data and require billions of compute hours to achieve a
    similar level of proficiency.

- **Poor common sense and reasoning**
  - Machine learning models often lack _common sense_ and the ability to reason
    intuitively. They don't have an inherent understanding of the world or the
    ability to apply logic in the way humans do. This means they can make
    decisions that seem illogical or lack the depth of understanding that comes
    naturally to humans.

</center>

- **Opaque decision-making**
  - Machine learning models, especially complex ones like deep neural networks,
    often act as "black boxes." This means that while they can make accurate
    predictions or decisions, it's not always clear how they arrived at those
    conclusions. This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in
    critical areas like healthcare or finance, where understanding the reasoning
    behind a decision is crucial for trust and accountability.

- **Dependence on narrow objectives**
  - Machine learning systems are designed to perform specific tasks very well,
    but they struggle when the goals are not clearly defined. For example, an
    algorithm designed to increase user engagement might inadvertently promote
    content that is misleading or harmful because it focuses solely on
    engagement metrics without understanding the broader context or
    consequences.

- **Susceptibility to bias and data quality**
  - Machine learning models learn from data, and if that data contains biases,
    the models will likely reflect and even amplify those biases. This can lead
    to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, highlighting the importance of using
    high-quality, representative data and implementing strategies to mitigate
    bias.

- **Lack of embodiment and physical interaction**
  - Unlike humans, machine learning models do not have physical bodies or
    sensory experiences. Human intelligence is deeply connected to our physical
    interactions with the world, which provide context and understanding that
    machines currently lack. This absence of embodiment limits the ability of
    machines to fully replicate human-like understanding and reasoning.

- **In practice, ML involves solving a practical problem by:**
  - **Gathering a dataset**: This is the first step in any machine learning
    project. You need data to train your model. The data should be relevant to
    the problem you're trying to solve.
  - **Building a statistical model from the dataset algorithmically**: Once you
    have your data, you use algorithms to create a model that can make
    predictions or decisions based on that data.

- **The three assumptions of machine learning:**
  - **A pattern exists**: Machine learning relies on the idea that there is some
    underlying pattern in the data that can be learned. If no pattern exists,
    the model won't be able to make accurate predictions.
  - **Pattern cannot be precisely defined mathematically**: If you can define
    the solution with a simple formula, you don't need machine learning.
    However, ML can still be useful for complex patterns that are hard to
    define.
  - **Data is available**: You need data to train your model. Without data, you
    can't make any progress. This is why data is often considered the most
    crucial element in machine learning.

- **Which ML assumption is essential?**
  - **A pattern exists**: This is the foundation of machine learning. If there's
    no pattern, the model won't work. You can try to learn from the data, but if
    it doesn't work, it might be because there's no pattern.
  - **Pattern cannot be precisely defined mathematically**: If you can solve the
    problem with a straightforward formula, machine learning might not be
    necessary. However, it can still be useful for more complex problems.
  - **Data is available**: Without data, you can't train a model. This makes
    data availability crucial for any machine learning project.

# 19 / 19: AI vs ML vs Deep-Learning

</center>

![](msml610/book/Lesson01.1-AI_and_Machine_Learning.png/slides019.png){width=80%}

</center>

- **AI**
  - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the broad concept of machines
    being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart." This
    involves programming machines to mimic human reasoning, learning, and
    decision-making processes. AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and
    applications, from simple rule-based systems to complex neural networks.

- **ML**
  - **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on the idea that
    machines can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to
    perform a task, machines use algorithms to identify patterns and make
    decisions based on data. This allows them to improve over time as they are
    exposed to more data.

- **AI without ML**
  - AI can exist without ML, as seen in rule-based systems like IBM's Deep Blue,
    which played chess by following pre-defined rules and strategies rather than
    learning from data.

- **Deep Learning (DL)**
  - **Deep Learning** is a specialized form of ML that uses neural networks with
    many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various levels of data abstraction.
    This approach is particularly effective for tasks like image and speech
    recognition.

- **Large Language Models (LLM)**
  - **Large Language Models** are a type of deep learning model specifically
    designed to understand and generate human language. They are trained on vast
    amounts of text data and often use techniques like Reinforcement Learning
    from Human Feedback (RLHF) to refine their outputs, making them capable of
    tasks like translation, summarization, and conversation.
