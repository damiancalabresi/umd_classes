  - People typically do not unsubscribe from funding-related emails
- Optimal send days
  - Best response rates observed Tuesday to Thursday
- Response timing
  - Significant number of replies occur over the weekend
- Communication habits vary
  - Some contacts are highly responsive, others consistently ignore emails
- Multi-channel strategy
  - Combine emails with LinkedIn messages for broader engagement
- Multiple touchpoints
  - Send follow-up emails with slightly varied messaging
- Provide opt-out clarity
  - Include an option like “unsubscribe here” to allow disengagement
  - Knowing someone is uninterested is better than being ignored
- Systematic removal
  - Remove clearly uninterested contacts from tracking systems

##### Favorite tools for outreach and tracking
- Task tracking: Asana or Spreadsheets
  - Track past actions and next steps
  - Use dates to set reminders
  - Prefer Asana if:
    - The outreach pipeline is complex
    - The number of people to track is small
- Scheduling: Calendly or alternatives
  - Once you have attention, convert it with minimal friction
  - Avoid back-and-forth by using automatic scheduling tools
  - Use tools like Calendly or open-source equivalents
  - Keep meetings short, ideally no more than 30 minutes

##### Tools for sourcing and messaging
- Define your target list
  - Create a list of “targets” based on job description and fit
- Sourcing automation
  - Recommended tool: [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/)
- Email outreach
  - Favorite tool: [Yet Another Mail Merge (YAMM)](https://yamm.com/)
  - Avoid platforms like Mailchimp or Constant Contact
    - These tools focus on visual design
    - “Fancy” emails reduce perceived authenticity and engagement

##### Follow up strategy
- Multiple pings
  - Same recipient contacted more than once
- Observation
  - Responses depend on availability
- Intuition
  - Catching attention at the right moment matters more than novelty
