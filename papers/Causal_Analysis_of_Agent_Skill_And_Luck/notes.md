Below is a ranked list of human activities and jobs, ordered roughly from most dependent on luck to most dependent on skill.
This is not absolute; rankings reflect typical outcomes over a population, not individual cases.

| Rank | Activity / Job                          | Dominant Factor | Notes |
|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1    | Lottery gambling                        | Luck            | Outcomes almost entirely random |
| 2    | Casino games (slots, roulette)          | Luck            | Skill has negligible impact |
| 3    | Inheritance / family background         | Luck            | Determined before individual action |

| 7    | Venture capital startup success         | Luck-heavy      | Market timing dominates outcomes |
| 8    | Stock picking (short-term trading)      | Luck-heavy      | Noise overwhelms signal short-term |
| 9    | Academic career (tenure-track)          | Mixed           | Skill + timing + gatekeepers |

| 12   | Entrepreneurship (small business)       | Mixed           | Execution + location + shocks |
| 13   | Journalism / writing careers            | Mixed           | Quality + attention dynamics |
| 14   | Software startup engineering            | Skill-leaning   | Skill important, market still risky |
| 15   | Competitive chess / esports             | Skill-leaning   | Luck minimal over many games |
| 16   | Professional programming                | Skill           | Outcomes strongly skill-driven |
| 17   | Engineering (civil, mechanical)         | Skill           | Errors and successes traceable |
| 18   | Medicine (clinical practice)            | Skill           | High training, bounded uncertainty |
| 19   | Skilled trades (electrician, plumber)   | Skill           | Experience directly impacts results |
| 20   | Craftsmanship (luthier, watchmaker)     | Skill           | Mastery dominates outcomes |
| 21   | Mathematics / theoretical research      | Skill           | Luck in insight exists, but skill dominates |
| 22   | Classical music performance             | Skill           | Precision and training decisive |
How to interpret the ranking
Luck-dominated: Individual effort has little effect on outcomes.

Mixed: Skill is necessary, but luck strongly shapes who succeeds.

Skill-dominated: Outcomes reliably improve with ability and practice.

Important caveats
Rankings assume many trials (long careers, repeated outcomes).

At short timescales, luck matters more almost everywhere.

Institutions can amplify or suppress luck (e.g., safety nets, tournaments).

| Rank | Activity / Job                          | Income Driver | Notes |
|------|----------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| 1    | Lottery gambling                        | Luck          | Extreme payouts, zero skill signal |
| 2    | Inheritance / family wealth             | Luck          | Income unrelated to individual effort |

| 22   | Applied scientist / mathematician       | Skill         | Earnings reflect rare expertise |
Key patterns
Income is more luck-driven than performance in winner-take-all markets.

Skill dominates income in regulated, credentialed, or craft-based professions.

The upper tail of income distributions is almost always luck-amplified.

ChatGPT said:
Below are two separate re-rankings of activities and jobs: one by social status and one by social impact, each ordered from most luck-driven to most skill-driven outcomes.

Both focus on how people typically gain recognition or influence, not moral worth.

Re-ranking by Social Status
| Rank | Activity / Role                         | Status Driver | Notes |
|------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| 1    | Royalty / inherited aristocracy         | Luck          | Status assigned at birth |

| 20   | Craftsperson                            | Skill         | Mastery-based respect |
Pattern (Status)
Status is more luck-sensitive than income.

Visibility and narratives dominate over contribution.

Winner-take-all dynamics amplify small random differences.

Re-ranking by Social Impact
| Rank | Activity / Role                         | Impact Driver | Notes |
|------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| 1    | Viral content creator                   | Luck          | Impact unpredictable, fleeting |

| 3    | Speculative finance                     | Luck-heavy    | Impact often indirect or neutral |
| 4    | Political leader (short tenure)         | Luck-heavy    | Context dominates effectiveness |
| 5    | Startup founder (median outcome)        | Mixed         | Few high-impact successes |
| 6    | Journalist (agenda-setting roles)       | Mixed         | Skill + institutional leverage |
| 7    | Policy-maker / regulator                | Mixed         | Skill filtered through politics |
| 8    | Senior corporate executive              | Mixed         | Impact depends on firm context |

| 17   | Environmental scientist                 | Skill         | Policy-relevant evidence |
| 18   | Civil servant (operational roles)       | Skill         | Consistent service delivery |
| 19   | Skilled trades (utilities, safety)      | Skill         | Quiet but essential impact |
| 20   | Caregiver / nurse                       | Skill         | High direct human impact |
Pattern (Impact)
Sustained impact correlates more with skill than visibility.

Institutions with feedback loops reduce luck’s role.

High-impact work is often low-status and low-variance.

How to read this table
Luck Dependence: how much outcomes vary due to randomness, timing, or attention.

Social Impact: durability, scale, and reliability of positive effects on others.

High-luck roles can achieve huge impact, but only rarely and unpredictably.

Low-luck roles deliver consistent, compounding impact across time.

Key insight
The activities with the greatest and most reliable social impact are usually those where luck matters least and feedback, standards, and accountability are strongest.
